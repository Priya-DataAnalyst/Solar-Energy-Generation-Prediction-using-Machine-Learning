# solar energy generation prediction

## overview
this project predicts **solar energy generation** using historical weather and solar data. multiple machine learning models were built and compared, including **linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, decision trees, and svm**. results support accurate forecasting and energy planning, with visualizations created in tableau for better insights.

## key features
- cleaned and engineered historical solar and weather datasets  
- implemented linear, tree-based, and ensemble models for prediction  
- evaluated models using **mae, rmse, and rÂ²** to compare performance  
- generated actionable recommendations for improving energy predictions  
- created an interactive **tableau dashboard** for visual exploration
